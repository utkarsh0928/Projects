# Myntra Clone 👗🛍️

A basic front-end clone of the popular e-commerce fashion website [Myntra](https://www.myntra.com/), built using **HTML** and **CSS**.

This project is a part of my learning journey in front-end web development. It focuses on building a responsive and visually similar layout to the original Myntra homepage.
